# Mycelica Vision

> What if we organized external knowledge the way neurons organize internal knowledge?

## The Problem

Knowledge is scattered. AI conversations disappear into chat history. Notes live in 5 different apps. Ideas connect across domains but tools force hierarchical folders.

Real thinking is **associative**—one idea triggers another. Current tools don't support this.

## The Solution

**Mycelica** is a visual knowledge graph for all your thoughts. Named after mycelium—the underground fungal network that connects forest ecosystems.

Everything goes in:
- AI conversations (Claude, ChatGPT)
- Notes (quick and deep)
- Voice memos (transcribed)
- Bookmarks, code snippets, research threads

Everything gets connected automatically. Everything becomes searchable by meaning, not just keywords.

## Core Principles

### 1. Associative, Not Hierarchical
Notes have multiple retrieval paths (alt-titles). Connections are weighted. Depth adapts to domain complexity.

### 2. AI-Assisted, Human-Verified
Connections are discovered automatically. Contradictions surface structurally. Humans validate what matters.

### 3. Local-First
Your data lives on your device. No cloud required for core functionality.

### 4. Decentralized by Design
Built with future federation in mind. Trust derived from graph structure rather than central authority.

## Roadmap

```
Phase 1 (current)  →  Personal knowledge graph (desktop app)
Phase 2            →  Multi-user collaboration features
Phase 3 (future)   →  Optional federation for shared knowledge bases
```

## Success Metric

**Using Mycelica daily. Finding old and most relevant conversations quickly and easily. Discovering connections I'd forgotten.**

Everything else follows from that.
