## Task

Add a doc comment to the generate_task_file function in src-tauri/src/bin/cli.rs explaining what each section of the generated task file contains (Task, Previous Bounce, Graph Context, Checklist) and how the FTS+Dijkstra context gathering works

## Graph Context

Relevant nodes found by search + Dijkstra traversal from the task description.
Use `mycelica_node_get` or `mycelica_read_content` to read full content of any node.

_No relevant nodes found in the graph._

## Checklist

- [ ] Read relevant context nodes above before starting
- [ ] Record implementation as operational node when done
- [ ] Link implementation to modified code nodes with edges
